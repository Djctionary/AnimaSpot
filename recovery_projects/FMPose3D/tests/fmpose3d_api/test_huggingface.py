"""
FMPose3D: monocular 3D Pose Estimation via Flow Matching

Official implementation of the paper:
"FMPose3D: monocular 3D Pose Estimation via Flow Matching"
by Ti Wang, Xiaohang Yu, and Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis
Licensed under Apache 2.0

Tests for HuggingFace Hub integration (model weight downloading).

Verifies that ``FMPose3DInference._download_model_weights`` resolves the
correct repo/filename for each model type, raises helpful errors when
``huggingface_hub`` is not installed, and that the auto-download path is
triggered when no explicit weights path is provided.
